# Piscine

A month long, 7/7, bootcamp-style selection procedure for the 19 coding school in Brussels (part of the 42 network).

In this repository you can find all my submitted code in C that passed the moulinette(= a testing program that compares the output against the epected output for numerous tests) qnd peer corrections.

I completed my remote piscine (due to covid) in september.

# Norme

Code was written in a style to be in accordance with the [normev3](https://github.com/42School/norminette) rules.
